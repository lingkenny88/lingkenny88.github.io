	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I am 18 years old and currently a sophomore at Tufts University.  I lived in New Paltz, New York for 10 years before I moved to Highland, New York where I finished middle and high school.  I am now working on getting a minor in computer science, and I enjoy creating text adventures in my spare time.
